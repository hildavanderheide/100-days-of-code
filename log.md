# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 28th, 2019
Started on my new Django app, this will replace an Excel registration sheet for our household expenses. I will share the code later on ofcourse but the data will be kept to myself ;) Done nothing more than starting the new app following https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/ and sketching up some of the models to be.
