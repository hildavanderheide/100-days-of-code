# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 28th, 2019
Started on my new Django app, this will replace an Excel registration sheet for our household expenses. I will share the code later on ofcourse but the data will be kept to myself ;) Done nothing more than starting the new app following https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/ and sketching up some of the models to be.

### Day 1: January 29th, 2019
Been fiddling around with setting up the database for my Django project, aim to use MySQL instead of SQLite. Have much more experience with TSQL so it's a tour of minor discoveries so far :)

### Day 2: January 30th, 2019
Spent some time on setting up Git Desktop, looks nice. First time I'm doing a larger project on macOS so still getting used to the in ins/outs. Also did some troubleshooting on the Django/MySQL connector, didnt work out of the box with mysqlclient.

### Day 3: January 31th, 2019
Been setting up my models to match with the .csv import file i will be using later on, quite a job with 40 columns and figuring out how to normalise it in the end.

### Day 4: February 1st, 2019
Something totally different today. Built a tool in Python for a colleague where he can enter a product reference and gets all relevant master data in return
